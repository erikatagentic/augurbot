## Bets Placed

### Bet 1: Denver at Oklahoma City — DEN YES at 36¢
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26FEB27DENOKC-DEN
- **Contracts:** 16 | **Cost:** $5.76 | **Potential profit:** $10.24
- **AI Estimate:** 60% | **Market:** 36% | **Edge:** 24% | **EV:** 22.4%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Order status:** EXECUTED

**Key factors:**
1. **Injuries (OKC depleted):** SGA out 24 days (GTD, earliest return Feb 27), Jalen Williams confirmed OUT (hamstring, Mar 7), Hartenstein OUT (calf), Holmgren GTD (back spasms), Caruso GTD (ankle). OKC potentially missing their top 5 scorers.
2. **Model context:** OKC went 2-3 without SGA. Without SGA + Williams + Hartenstein, they're fielding a skeleton crew. OKC has never been this depleted this season.
3. **Denver's strength:** Jokic healthy (#1 offensive rating in NBA at 122.18). MPJ available. Gordon OUT but Murray GTD.
4. **H2H:** OKC won 121-111 at Denver on Feb 1 WITH SGA (34 pts). Without SGA, this is a completely different matchup.
5. **Market mispricing:** 36% reflects OKC's season record (44-14), not their current injury-depleted state. Massive opportunity.

### Bet 2: Cleveland at Detroit — DET YES at 60¢
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26FEB27CLEDET-DET
- **Contracts:** 9 | **Cost:** $5.40 | **Potential profit:** $3.60
- **AI Estimate:** 74% | **Market:** 60% | **Edge:** 14% | **EV:** 12.3%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Order status:** RESTING

**Key factors:**
1. **Detroit dominance:** 42-14 (#1 in East), 22-7 at home (elite), W5 streak, fully healthy roster. Cade Cunningham MVP candidate (25.3 ppg, 9.8 apg).
2. **Cleveland depleted:** Mitchell OUT(?), Mobley OUT(?), Strus OUT, Harden GTD. All four listed "expected out until at least Feb 27." Potential to be missing their top 4 players.
3. **Scheduling:** Detroit at home all week (no travel). Cleveland traveling Milwaukee → Detroit (second road game in 3 days).
4. **Defense:** Detroit's 109.17 defensive rating (#2 in NBA) would clamp depleted Cleveland offense.
5. **NBA correction (+6%):** Applied per calibration feedback (NBA underestimate bias).
