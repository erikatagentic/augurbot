## New Bet Placed

### 1. Miami at Philadelphia — NO (MIA wins)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26FEB26MIAPHI-PHI
- **Direction:** NO (bet against Philadelphia)
- **Price:** 50¢ | **Contracts:** 10 | **Cost:** $5.00
- **AI Estimate:** PHI 38% | **Market:** 50% | **Edge:** 12.0% | **EV:** 10.25%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Key factors driving the estimate:**
1. **Embiid OUT since Feb 7** — chronic knee/shin, hasn't played in 5+ games. PHI is 1-6 without him recently. This is -13% off the base rate.
2. **ESPN BPI base:** PHI 54.4% at home → adjusted to ~38% without Embiid
3. **MIA H2H dominance:** 7-3 in last 10 meetings, already beat PHI at PHI this season (127-117, Powell 32 pts, Ware 20/16)
4. **MIA better net rating:** +3.0 vs PHI +0.3. MIA has Herro back from 15-game absence, Adebayo healthy.
5. **Market inefficiency:** 50/50 pricing doesn't reflect the Embiid absence. Market may be pricing in a possible Embiid return, but he hasn't played in weeks.

## Markets Researched but Not Bet

### Charlotte at Indiana (CHA YES at 73%)
- **AI Estimate:** CHA 72% | **EV:** -0.38% (no edge)
- Indiana devastated by injuries (Haliburton OUT for season, Siakam/Zubac/Toppin/Nesmith OUT, Mathurin traded). Charlotte 9-1 L10 with LaMelo Ball MVP-caliber. But market already efficiently priced at 73%.

### Michigan St. at Purdue (PUR YES at 74%)
- **AI Estimate:** PUR 71% | **EV:** 1.65% (below 8% threshold)
- All models converge (BPI 71.9%, Torvik 75%, KenPom ~72%). Purdue fully healthy at Mackey Arena. Small edge for NO but not actionable.

## Performance Snapshot
- **Overall Brier:** 0.227 (target: <0.18)
- **Hit rate:** 49% on 173 recommendations
- **Total P&L:** $+86.03
- **Open bets:** 16 + 1 new = 17
- **Bankroll:** $105.03 cash / $151.65 total
- **CLV:** +5.1% avg (48% positive — line movement confirms edge identification)

## Calibration Notes
- NBA: -7.3% underestimate bias (applied +7% correction)
- NCAA: +5.8% overestimate bias (applied -3% correction since model-based)
- Trend: Brier 0.210 → 0.295 → 0.216 (deteriorating, need tighter estimates)
