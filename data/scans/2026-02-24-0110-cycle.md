## Bets Placed

### Bet 1: Boston Celtics at Denver — YES (Boston wins)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26FEB25BOSDEN-BOS
- **Direction:** YES | **Price:** 44¢ | **Contracts:** 13 | **Cost:** $5.72
- **AI Estimate:** 60% | **Market:** 44% | **Edge:** 16% | **EV:** 14.3%
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Key factors:**
  - Nikola Jokic OUT (knee bone bruise) — massive swing, Denver's entire offense revolves around him
  - Jaylen Brown in MVP form: 29.5 PPG career-high, 20+ pts in 15 straight
  - Celtics 8-2 last 10, on 3-game win streak
  - **Offsets:** Celtics on B2B (at Phoenix Feb 24) + altitude in Denver (-6%)
  - Murray, Gordon, Braun all available for Denver despite being questionable
- **Order status:** EXECUTED

### Bet 2: Sacramento at Houston — NO (Houston wins)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26FEB25SACHOU-SAC
- **Direction:** NO | **Price:** 83¢ | **Contracts:** 6 | **Cost:** $4.98
- **AI Estimate:** 8% (SAC wins) | **Market:** 17% | **Edge:** 9% | **EV:** 8.0%
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Key factors:**
  - Kings 12-46 on NBA-worst 16-game losing streak
  - Sabonis OUT (season), LaVine OUT (season), Hunter OUT (season) — roster gutted
  - Rockets 33-20, 8-2 last 10, strong at home
  - 17¢ for Sacramento is too generous given their current state
- **Order status:** RESTING

### Bet 3: Wisconsin at Oregon — NO (Oregon wins)
- **Ticker:** KXNCAAMBGAME-26FEB25WISORE-WIS
- **Direction:** NO | **Price:** 22¢ | **Contracts:** 26 | **Cost:** $5.72
- **AI Estimate:** 64% (Wisconsin wins) → 36% Oregon | **Market:** 78% Wisconsin → 22% Oregon | **Edge:** 14% | **EV:** 12.8%
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Key factors:**
  - KenPom #29 (Wisconsin) vs #97 (Oregon), but 78% for an away team is steep
  - Oregon decimated: only 8 scholarship players (Shelstad, Demir, Pryor all OUT for season)
  - Wisconsin 19-8, AP #24, strong recent form (beat MSU by 21)
  - **But:** Home court advantage in CBB worth ~8-10% win probability
  - -7% NCAA calibration correction applied (we overestimate in NCAA)
  - Oregon still has Kwame Evans Jr. and nothing to lose
- **Order status:** RESTING
