## Bets Placed

### 1. Vanderbilt YES at Kentucky — 22 contracts at 30¢ ($6.60)
**AI: 72% | Market: 30% | Edge: 42% | EV: 40.5% | Confidence: HIGH**

Key factors:
- **Injury: Kentucky missing 3 key players** — Jaland Lowe OUT (shoulder surgery), Jayden Quaintance OUT (knee/ACL rehab), Kam Williams OUT (foot surgery). Catastrophic roster depletion.
- **Model: KenPom** — Vanderbilt #12 (AdjEM ~+25), Kentucky significantly lower. KenPom gave UK only 26% in first meeting (Nashville).
- **Form: Vanderbilt elite offense** — 90+ PPG, one of highest in country. Duke Miles returned from knee surgery.
- **Home court at Rupp Arena** adds ~8% to Kentucky, but injury gap overwhelms it.
- **Market at 30% is absurdly low** — likely stale/thin. This is our highest-conviction bet.

### 2. Ole Miss NO at Auburn — 13 contracts at 50¢ ($6.50)
**AI: 18% Ole Miss wins | Market: 50% | Edge: 32% | EV: 30.2% | Confidence: HIGH**

Key factors:
- **Model: ESPN BPI gives Auburn 81.4%** win probability. Spread Auburn -13.5.
- **Form: Ole Miss on 9-game losing streak** — 3-11 SEC, season has collapsed at 11-16 overall.
- **Shooting: Ole Miss at 41% FG, 13% 3PT** in recent games — historically bad.
- **Auburn motivation:** Fighting for NCAA tournament bubble, snapped 5-game losing streak beating Kentucky 75-74.
- **Market at 50% is clearly mispriced** — thin market with no price discovery.

### 3. Florida YES vs Arkansas — 13 contracts at 48¢ ($6.24)
**AI: 72% Florida wins | Market: 48% | Edge: 24% | EV: 22.3% | Confidence: MEDIUM**

Key factors:
- **Model: KenPom** — Florida #7 (AdjEM +29.81, AdjD 93.6 #9), Arkansas #17 (AdjEM +26.51).
- **Form: Florida on 8-game win streak** including 7 straight road wins. College GameDay atmosphere.
- **Injury: Arkansas missing Karter Knox** (meniscus surgery) and Isaiah Sealy. Depth tested.
- **Arkansas 223rd in defensive rebounding** — Florida frontcourt (Condon avg 23-24 PPG) will exploit.
- **SEC title implications:** Florida 13-2 can clinch with a win.

### 4. Iowa State NO vs Texas Tech — 13 contracts at 50¢ ($6.50)
**AI: 26% Tech wins | Market: 50% | Edge: 24% | EV: 22.2% | Confidence: MEDIUM**

Key factors:
- **Model: Barttorvik** — Iowa State 24-4 T-Rank #9 vs Texas Tech 21-7 T-Rank #10, similar ratings BUT Iowa State is 15-0 at Hilton Coliseum.
- **Injury: JT Toppin ACL tear Feb 17** — projected All-American, Texas Tech's best player is done for season.
- **Home dominance:** Tech is 6-16 ALL-TIME at Hilton Coliseum, last win Jan 2021. "Hilton Magic" is real.
- **Iowa State already beat #2 Houston and #9 Kansas** at home this season.

### 5. North Carolina NO vs Virginia Tech — 13 contracts at 50¢ ($6.50)
**AI: 31% VT wins | Market: 50% | Edge: 19% | EV: 17.2% | Confidence: MEDIUM**

Key factors:
- **Model: KenPom** — UNC #16 (AdjEM +21.26), Virginia Tech #42 (AdjEM +13.64). Gap of ~7.6 points.
- **Injury: UNC's Caleb Wilson OUT** (fractured left hand) — star player, won't return until Duke game. But Henri Veesaar returned (19 pts in comeback game).
- **Home dominance:** Dean Smith Center, UNC has 9 straight home wins vs VT.
- **VT inconsistent:** Beat Wake Forest 82-63 but also lost to Miami 67-66 and FSU 92-69.

## Balance
- **Cash:** $133.01 → ~$100.67 after bets
- **Portfolio:** $33.50 + $32.34 new = ~$65.84
- **Total:** ~$166.51

## Notes
- All NCAA markets priced at 48-50% suggest extremely thin liquidity. Orders are all resting and may not fill before game time.
- 5 of 5 bets are NCAA Basketball — no NBA bets this cycle due to coin-flip estimates or insufficient edge.
- NCAA underestimation bias (+5%) from calibration was applied during research.
- Vanderbilt/Kentucky is highest conviction: 72% AI vs 30% market is a massive gap driven by Kentucky's 3 missing key players.
