## Bets Placed

### 1. Portland at Chicago — YES at 55¢ (8 contracts, $4.40)
**Ticker**: KXNBAGAME-26FEB26PORCHI-POR | **EV: 14.3%**

Key factors:
- **Tank mode**: Bulls on 9-game losing streak, made 7 trades at deadline dismantling roster. CBS "Tank Watch" designation.
- **Injuries**: Bulls missing Anfernee Simons (fractured wrist) and Jaden Ivey (knee) — both primary backcourt players
- **Form**: Portland 28-30, won 5 of last 7. Clingan (23/13 vs PHX) and Grant stepping up.
- **Motivation**: Portland fighting for 9th seed play-in spot; Chicago has zero motivation
- **Portland injuries**: Avdija (back, day-to-day) and Sharpe (calf) OUT, but won without them

AI estimate: 71% | Market: 55% | Edge: 16% | Confidence: Medium

### 2. Minnesota at LA Clippers — YES at 61¢ (7 contracts, $4.27)
**Ticker**: KXNBAGAME-26FEB26MINLAC-MIN | **EV: 9.3%**

Key factors:
- **Roster gutted**: Clippers traded Harden to CLE, Garland (acquired back) week-to-week with toe injury
- **Injuries**: John Collins OUT (head laceration), Kawhi ankle lingering
- **Records**: MIN 35-23 (6th West) vs LAC 27-30 (10th West) — significant gap
- **LAC home woes**: Historically terrible record at Intuit Dome (0-8 stretch earlier)
- **Risk**: Kawhi had 41 pts in last meeting (Feb 8) — can single-handedly win

AI estimate: 72% | Market: 61% | Edge: 11% | Confidence: Medium
