## Bets Placed

### 1. OKC at Dallas — NO on OKC (EV 15.4%)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26MAR01OKCDAL-OKC
- **Direction:** NO | Price: 9¢ | Contracts: 76 | Cost: $6.84
- **AI Estimate:** OKC 75% | Market: 91% | Edge: 16%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Key factors:**
  - OKC 46-15 (best in West) vs DAL 21-38 — massive gap justifies high price
  - Jalen Williams OUT (hamstring, not back until ~Mar 7) — OKC's #2 scorer
  - SGA just returned from 9-game absence, dropped 36 pts
  - Mavs gutted: Cooper Flagg OUT (midfoot), Kyrie Irving OUT (knee surgery), Dereck Lively OUT (foot)
  - Hard cap at 75% limits estimate — market at 91% still seems high for road game with key absence

### 2. LAC at Golden State — YES on LAC (EV 12.3%)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26MAR02LACGSW-LAC
- **Direction:** YES | Price: 42¢ | Contracts: 16 | Cost: $6.72
- **AI Estimate:** LAC 56% | Market: 42% | Edge: 14%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Key factors:**
  - GSW devastated: Curry OUT (knee, re-eval Mar 1), Butler OUT (torn ACL), Porzingis OUT (Achilles), Green DTD
  - Warriors 6-11 without Curry, 3-9 without both Curry and Butler
  - GSW has lost 8 straight home games vs LAC
  - LAC also hurt (Garland OUT, Beal OUT for season, Kawhi questionable) but less devastated
  - Both on B2B (LAC from NOP game, GSW from LAL game) — neutralizes fatigue factor

### 3. Duke at NC State — NO on Duke (EV 10.9%)
- **Ticker:** KXNCAAMBGAME-26MAR02DUKENCST-DUKE
- **Direction:** NO | Price: 20¢ | Contracts: 34 | Cost: $6.80
- **AI Estimate:** Duke 68% | Market: 80% | Edge: 12%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Key factors:**
  - Duke #1 overall (26-2, KenPom #3, historic 39.29 net rating)
  - But this is a ROAD game — Duke's only ACC loss came on the road (at UNC 68-71)
  - NC State 19-9 (10-5 ACC), KenPom #27 — solid team fighting for NCAA tournament
  - Rivalry/motivation factor for NC State at home
  - 80% for a road game seems 10+ points too high even for elite Duke

### 4. Houston at Washington — NO on Houston (EV 10.2%)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26MAR02HOUWAS-HOU
- **Direction:** NO | Price: 14¢ | Contracts: 49 | Cost: $6.86
- **AI Estimate:** HOU 75% | Market: 86% | Edge: 11%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Key factors:**
  - HOU 33-20 vs WAS 16-41 — major talent gap, Wizards worst record in NBA
  - Rockets won first meeting 135-112 (23-point blowout)
  - But Rockets 5-5 in L10 with 4 losses in last 5 — inconsistent form
  - Road game at Capital One Arena — Rockets need to show up
  - Hard cap at 75%; market at 86% still seems 10+ points too high

### 5. Sacramento at LAL — NO on LAL (EV 9.1%)
- **Ticker:** KXNBAGAME-26MAR01SACLAL-LAL
- **Direction:** NO | Price: 15¢ | Contracts: 46 | Cost: $6.90
- **AI Estimate:** LAL 75% | Market: 85% | Edge: 10%
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Key factors:**
  - LAL 34-24 vs SAC 14-47 — Kings on 10-game losing streak, worst team in NBA
  - Kings decimated: Sabonis, LaVine, Hunter all season-ending; Murray and Monk hurt
  - Lakers on back-to-back (at Warriors Feb 28, home Mar 1) — fatigue factor
  - Luka Doncic available and off minute restriction
  - Hard cap at 75%; Kings still have some NBA talent and Lakers B2B is real
