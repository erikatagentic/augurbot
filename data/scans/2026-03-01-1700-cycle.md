## Bet Placed

### 1. TCU at Texas Tech — NO (TCU upset) @ 21¢
- **Ticker:** KXNCAAMBGAME-26MAR03TCUTTU-TTU
- **Direction:** NO | **Price:** 21¢ | **Contracts:** 18 | **Cost:** $3.78
- **AI Estimate:** TTU 59% | **Market Price:** TTU 79% | **Edge:** +20.0% | **EV:** +18.8%
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Order Status:** Resting (limit order)
- **Key factors:**
  - JT Toppin OUT for season (torn ACL) — consensus All-American, 21.8 ppg, 10.8 rpg
  - TTU went 3-0 without Toppin (incl. beat #4 Iowa State on road) — team adapted but still significant loss
  - TCU hot: 6 of last 7 wins, desperate bubble team with motivation
  - KenPom #16 vs #50 — 34-spot gap still favors TTU at home, but 79% overprices them without their best player
  - NCAA calibration: reduced raw 65% estimate to 59% (historical overestimation bias)

## Near Misses (Positive EV but failed gating)
- **DET at CLE YES:** EV 9.3% — Pistons #1 in NBA, Mitchell OUT for Cavs — but LOW liquidity (needs 12%)
- **Missouri at Oklahoma YES:** EV 11.3% — Missouri superior team — but LOW liquidity (needs 12%)

## Market Conditions
Very poor liquidity on Mar 3 markets (games 2 days out). Of 22 researched markets:
- 14 had zero volume and 70+ cent bid/ask spreads (untradeable)
- 5 had wide spreads and low volume (poor execution)
- Only 3 had reasonable liquidity (DET@CLE, TCU@TTU, ALA@GA)
- TCU@TTU was the only one with both positive EV AND sufficient liquidity

## Performance Snapshot
- **Brier:** 0.218 (target: <0.18)
- **Hit rate:** 51% on 211 recommended bets
- **P&L:** -$52.49 (actual)
- **Bankroll:** $148.01 total ($76.80 cash + $71.21 portfolio)
- **Open positions:** 14
- **Calibration biases:** NBA -6.6% (underestimate), NCAA +7.4% (overestimate)
