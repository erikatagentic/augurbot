Research this sports prediction market and provide your forecast.

Use your web searches strategically. Prioritize in this order:
1. INJURY REPORTS — Search "[team name] injury report today" for both sides. This is the single highest-impact factor.
2. RECENT RESULTS + STATS — Search "[team name] recent results stats" for win/loss record, scoring trends, and advanced metrics (net rating, efficiency).
3. MATCHUP CONTEXT — Search "[team A] vs [team B] preview prediction" for expert analysis, head-to-head history, and situational context (home/away, rest, schedule).
4. ADVANCED METRICS (if close matchup) — Search for sport-specific power ratings (KenPom, DVOA, net rating, xG) when evidence is mixed and you need a tiebreaker.
5. SITUATIONAL FACTORS (if relevant) — Referee assignment, weather for outdoor games, playoff implications, or coaching matchup details.
