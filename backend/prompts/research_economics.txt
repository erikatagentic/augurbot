Research this economics prediction market and provide your forecast.

Use your web searches strategically. Prioritize in this order:
1. CONSENSUS FORECAST — Search "[indicator] [month/quarter] [year] forecast consensus estimate" to find the Wall Street/Bloomberg consensus. This anchors your entire estimate.
2. NOWCASTS AND TRACKERS — Search for real-time trackers: "Atlanta Fed GDPNow" for GDP, "Cleveland Fed CPI nowcast" for inflation, "CME FedWatch" for Fed rates.
3. PRIOR DATA AND TREND — Search "[indicator] latest release [year]" for the most recent reading and trend direction.
4. LEADING INDICATORS — Search for indicator-specific leading data (e.g., PPI for CPI, ADP for payrolls, retail sales for GDP).
5. EXTERNAL FACTORS — Search for policy changes, energy prices, or shocks that could cause a surprise vs consensus.

After researching, follow the ANCHOR AND ADJUST methodology from your instructions:
- State the consensus forecast and how it maps to the question's threshold
- List each factor with its +/- adjustment in probability points
- Show the math to arrive at your final probability
